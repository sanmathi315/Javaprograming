DATA TYPES:
Java is considered a strongly typed language. To use a variable, the programmer must
declare the type of information that this variable can store. Java has eight data types that
are referred to as primitives (also known as elemental or simple types): byte,short,int,
long, float, double, char, and boolean. Java also has many predefined types that are
listed in the Java API, and the language allows the creation of user defined data types

Type Name Size Range:
boolean 8 bits true or false
byte 8 bits -128 to 127 (-27
 to 27
-1)
char 16 bits 0 to 65.535
short 16 bits -32,768 to 32,767 (-215 to 215-1)
int 32 bits -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647(-231 to 231-1)
float 32 bits ~-3.4 x 1038 to ~3.4 x 1038
long 64 bits ~-9.2 x 1015 to ~9.2 x 1015(-263 to 263-1)
double 64 bits ~-1.8 x 10308 to ~1.8 x 10308

VARIABLES:
Java supports three types of variables: local variables, instance variables, and class
variables. This section will discuss the placement and scope of variables within a Java
class.
syntax:
class MyClass
{
 // This is a comment
 double salary = 45678.00; // instance variable
 static int totalcount = 0; // class variable

 public static void main(String[] args)
 {
 char male = 'm'; // local variable
 }
}
